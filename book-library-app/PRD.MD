Build a simplified version of GoodReads using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application will allow users to register, log in, view a list of books, track their reading progress, and rate books.

Features to Implement
1. User Authentication
Register a new user using JWT and bcrypt.
Log in as an existing user.
Store user session using HTTP-only cookies.
Implement logout functionality.
2. Navigation Bar
Display the app title: "My Library".
Provide navigation links: Home, My Books (only if logged in), Login/Register (if not logged in), and Logout (if logged in).
Display logged-in user’s email.
3. Home Page
Fetch and display a list of books from MongoDB.
Show a loading message while fetching books.
Display books using a BookCard component.
A Book card has a Want to Read button. On click:
If logged in, add it to user's "My Books".
If not logged in, show an alert prompting login.
4. My Books Page
Display books added by the logged-in user.
Allow users to update reading status (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Read).
Allow users to rate books (1-5 stars).
5. State Management (Redux or Context API)
Manage authentication state (login, register, logout actions).
Fetch books from a central store.
Update book ratings and status in Redux/Context.
